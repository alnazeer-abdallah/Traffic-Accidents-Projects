## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of road accidents during 2021 and 2022. It examines various factors contributing to these accidents, including casualty types (fatal, serious, slight), date, time, light conditions, road surface conditions, and road types.

## Dataset
The dataset consisted of many tables represent accidents conditions : Accident_Index, Accident Date, Accident_Severity, Light_Conditions, Road_Surface_Conditions, Road_Type.

## Data Cleaning and Manipulation
Duplicate values were removed from all tables using their Accident_Index, road surface conditions related to snow, frost or ice were consolidated into a single category to streamline the analysis.
